# Final Project
In this analysis, we would examine the Titanic Classification with serveral method using Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and MLP Classifier, and later explain factors causing the model failure. This analysis is inspired by Baligh Mnassri's analysis about Titanic: Logistic Regression with Python with a score is 0.76076.
